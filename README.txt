READ ME ( holy crap I didn’t realize this was in github )

This game has no real story line, its a WIP to help High School CS teachers teach simple game elements to students.

My TODO list for this game so far:

1. main character than can walk around
	keyboard input
	sprite sheet
	animation
	physics
2. other sprites and a background… maybe objects
	sprite Groups
3. collision detection for walls, objects, and other sprites
	physics
4. talking to other people and being able to make a choices
	arrays
	if/else statements
	tweens ( fun animations ) 
	text ( BMText but its unnecessary ) 
5. setting global variables that change what people say or where you can go after you make a choice or whatever
6. multiple scenes -> it detects when you walk into a door and goes to a new scene ( each scene has its own load / create / update loop its easy to switch between )




4c. accepting input.
4d. Make github account ( should be first )
	sshKey
4e. different npc’s that have ranges of conversation importance
(auto generate)

backlog:
4b. having the text appear like typing.<- found a plugin
